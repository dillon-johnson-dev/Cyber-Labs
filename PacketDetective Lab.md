## In this lab with cyberdefenders.org, I use their lab to investigate PCAP files in wireshark to learn details about an attack and attacker.

### Scenario:
In September 2020, your SOC detected suspicious activity from a user device, flagged by unusual SMB protocol usage. Initial analysis indicates a possible compromise of a privileged account and remote access tool usage by an attacker.

Your task is to examine network traffic in the provided PCAP files to identify key indicators of compromise (IOCs) and gain insights into the attackerâ€™s methods, persistence tactics, and goals. Construct a timeline to better understand the progression of the attack by addressing the following questions.

### Tools Used:
Wireshark

### Steps taken:
